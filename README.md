### File overview
In the root directory, code can be found for topic modeling in TopicCode.ipynb, and the code for sentiment analysis can be found in SentimentAnalysis.ipynb. The .csv dataset used in both notebooks can be found in the root directory of the GitHub repository as well. To run the analysis code, as these notebooks were ran on Google Colab because of local computational limits, it will be necessary to adjust the pd.read_csv path.  

Code used for data scraping can be found in the Transcription_Tools directory.

The process of EDA and pandas dataset creation can be found in EDA.ipynb.
